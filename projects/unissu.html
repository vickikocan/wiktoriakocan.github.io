            Shortly after I joined the design team at Unissu, I was tasked with taking ownership of the build and management of their design system, Navarro.

        <p class="app-content">
            - PUT SOME CONNECTIVE TEXT HERE, eg what is Navarro, whats its purpose, what does it apply to -
        </p>
        <p class="app-content app-side-by-side">
            <span>I conducted research on how to structure the design system. Before putting any content in, I needed to know where to start and how best to structure the project. I chose to use the <a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">Atomic Design methodology by Brad Frost</a>, because it has an explicit order and hierarchy which simplifies entire interfaces into a set of elements. <br> <br>It was the ideal structure for this design system and it's helped to make it clear, structured and accessible.</span>

        <p class="app-content">
            - WHAT ARE ATOMS?? - I started with the "atoms". I went through all our design files and picked up the components that were the building blocks for bigger assets on our platform. These are elements that can’t be broken down any further, such as buttons, icons and labels.

            - WRITE MORE EHERE -
            I also included visual documentation of styles; this includes Colours, typography, images, illustrations, and elevations.

            - MOLECULES?? ORGANISMS??? -
            The patterns page holds the molecules and organisms of the system. These are groups of the “atom” elements that function together, such as navigations and sidebars. For a design system of this size, it was beneficial to combine them onto one page that I call patterns, since it limits the need to search through several pages. 
        </p>
        <p class="app-content app-side-by-side">
            <span>The templates show all of the components working together on a page. It is the skeleton of the pages that we see on the platform, as they hold no content. It lets us focus on the structure, allowing the bigger picture to be formed out of smaller components</span>

        </p>
        <p class="app-content">
            To make the design system accessible, I created a Playground page, it's a space for the team to learn the assets, find out how best to use them and engage in the discussion behind how the components were thought out.
        </p>
        <p class="app-content">
            To make onboarding to our team easier, I also created a presentation that introduces the design system to its users. My goal is to keep this system evergreen, and ever useful to the designers and developers. So far, it has saved the designers a lot of time when making iterations and kept everyone organised; it narrows the margin for error and keeps us consistent.
