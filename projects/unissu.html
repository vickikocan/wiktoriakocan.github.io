        <p class="app-content">
            Shortly after I joined the design team at Unissu, we were informed we needed to improve the handover between our team and the developers. I noticed that our design system was merely some copies of the elements from our platform, and offered to take charge of its build and management. 
        </p>
        <p class="app-content">
            First, I conducted desk research on how to structure a design system. Before putting any content in, I needed to know where to start. I chose to use the Atomic Design methodology by Brad Frost, because it has an explicit order and hierarchy that brakes entire interfaces into a set of elements. It was the correct structure to make this system and its assets accessible, editable, and evergreen.
        </p>
        <p class="app-content">
            Naturally, I started with the "atoms". I went through all our design files and picked up the components that were the building blocks for bigger assets on our platform. These are elements that can’t be broken down any further, such as buttons, icons and labels.
        </p>
        <p class="app-content">
            I also included visual documentation of styles; this includes Colours, typography, images, illustrations, and elevations.
        </p>
        <p class="app-content">
            The patterns page holds the molecules and organisms of the system. These are groups of the “atom” elements that function together, such as navigations and sidebars. For a design system of this size, it was beneficial to combine them onto one page that I call patterns, since it limits the need to search through several pages. 
        </p>
        <p class="app-content">
            The templates show all of the components working together on a page. It is the skeleton of the pages that we see on the platform, as they hold no content. It lets us focus on the structure, allowing the bigger picture to be formed out of smaller puzzle pieces!
        </p>
        <p class="app-content">
            Finally, I created a Playground page when I introduced the system to my team. This was a space for them to test the assets, learn how to use it to their advantage and poke holes that I could then fix. To make onboarding to our team easier, I also created a presentation that introduces the design system to its users. My goal is to keep this system evergreen, and ever useful to the designers and developers. So far, it has saved the designers a lot of time when making iterations and kept everyone organised; it narrows the margin for error and keeps us consistent.
