            In 2020, everyone was forced to become more reliant on online shopping. It went from being a pleasant convenience, to a modern necessity. Because of this, I had noticed more and more people criticising the ZARA website and app. It had become a common joke to mention their negative experience with it, and I decided I wanted to find out exactly why people were feeling this way, and what the ZARA customers really wanted.
        </p>
        <p class="app-content">
            I conducted a survey to find out who uses ZARA's online service, what they expected and hoped for, and what they would change about their experience with the website. They rated their experience at 3.3 stars out of 5, and the ease of use on the website at 3.4 out of 5. <br>
            The positive comments mentioned the unique layout, how it felt like looking through a magazine. However, the most common negatives mentioned the confusing layout, the long menu, and the images being too big.
        </p>
        <p class="app-content">
            Next, I conducted usability testing. Through this, I found the specifics of what the users wanted to change to improve their user experience. The most frequent negative comments were: <br>
        </p>
        <ol class="app-list app-list--cards">
            <li>
                The menu is too long, therefore overwhelming
            </li>
            <li>
                The layout is confusing. Columns were inconsistent
            </li>
            <li>
                Images are too large and sometimes are not focused on the product itself
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="app-content">
            The most frequent positive comments were:
        </p>
        <ol class="app-list app-list--cards">
            <li>
                Unique, editorial aesthetic
            </li>
            <li>
                It is easy to navigate
            </li>
            <li>
                It is responsive
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="app-content">
            Afterwards, I asked the users to do some card sorting. I wanted to find out how they would structure the main menu on ZARA's website.
